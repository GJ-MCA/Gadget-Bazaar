If stripe cli is not listening then the payment webhook can not be catched, so to listen it we need to perform these steps.
After enabling, it will be available for 90 minutes.

Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks

Steps:
./stripe login --interactive
enter stripe secret key

./stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:5000/backend-gadgetbazaar/payment/stripe-webhook


Can also trigger it for testing directly:
./stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
